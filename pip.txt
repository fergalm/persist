How to upload to pip

1. Ensure all unit tests pass
2. Bump version number in setup.py
3. `python setup.py sdist`  to create new tarball
4. Upload to pypy

python setup.py sdist
python -m twine upload -r testpypi dist/persistable-$version.tar.gz


For pypy itself
twine upload dist/objpersist-$version -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
You have to pass the password because otherwise pip insists on
looking for it in keyring, but keyring doesn't work.

Username is fergalm, firefox has the password
